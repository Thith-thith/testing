Almost 2 years ago we [open sourced](https://twitter.com/vercel/status/1188911002626097157) SWR, the tiny data-fetching React library that people love. Today we are reaching another milestone: the 1.0 version of SWR!

## Whatâ€™s New

### Smaller Size

[Performance](/docs/advanced/performance) is one of the most important features of SWR. In 1.0, we made the library significantly smaller **without removing any existing features**:

- 41% smaller core (24% smaller when gzipped, **3.9 kB**)
- 52% smaller package install size
- Improved tree-shaking
