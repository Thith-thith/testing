Since it has power to propose and validate blogs that will have many assets live on top, it could also be used as collateral in future DeFi platform, as payment earned for performing services or selling of real world good and much more.

### Planks number
```js
+ 1 SEL = 1.000,000,000,000 PicoSEL (One thousand billion or Plank 10^12)
+ 1 PicoSEL = 0.000,000,000,001 SEL or 10^-12
```

### Inflation		

New SEL tokens enter into circulation via inflation then distribute in a form of reward to validators and stakers for helping to secure and navigate the network. Inflation is set to be between 0.5% - 2.5% per year, with initial supply starting of 527,626,784 SEL.

```bash
- max:	    10,763,227	2.50%
- average:	4,305,291	1.00%
- min:	    2,152,645	0.50%
```
### Deflation

At least up to 100,000,000 SEL from pre-mined `Foundation Governance` & `Bridge Liquidity/Parachain Crowdloan` pool will be burned at the rate of 1 SEL token for each transaction made on the `Selendra Network`. 

On top of that, `70%` of fees collected from the transactions will also be burned, while `30%` of the fees and tips from the transaction will be rewarded to **block authors**.   

```js
Fees
- 70% burned, while;  
- 30% + Tips reward to blocks producers or blocks authors.
```

### Max supply control

The Maximum supply of SEL token is set to be 3,141,592,654 SEL. 

With an average inflation of 1.5% per year and the initial supply of 527,626,784 SEL, it will take 120 years to reach 3,145,998,227 SEL. 

### Fees 

Base transaction fees is currently set to be at 0.0001 SEL per transaction or 10,000 transacton for every SEL. 

The fees could be reduced, if it will ever becoming too expensive for users and developers to use. 

The update change the fees holders and summit proposal on the `governance` portal. 


SEL could compare to a company stocks

- Yield = Dividend  
- Burn  = Buy back
- Earn  = Fees generated
